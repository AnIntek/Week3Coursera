## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
x <- list(a = 1:4, b = rnorm(10), c = rnorm(20,1), d = rnorm(100,5))
lapply(x, mean)
sapply(x,mean)


x<- matrix(rnorm(200), 20, 10)
apply(x,2,mean)

apply(x,1,sum)
# optimized
rowsum() = apply(x,1,sum)
rowMeans() = apply(x,1,mean)
colSums() = apply(x,2,sum)
colMeans() = apply(x,2,mean)
```
